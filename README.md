# adventofcode-2021

A colleague asked me to look at a particular problem from 2021 and that of course opened the gates. I hadn't done AoC for 2020 or 2021, but no reason not to go back.

I will use TypeScript in general, but I may experiment with other options. I may also just not complete any. :)
